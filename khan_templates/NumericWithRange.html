                    Assume we have a corpus of 1000 words and the following WordNet
                    Hierarchy: <br/>

                    <img src="images/Information_Content.png"
                    alt="Node A has children B, C and D. Node B has children E and F. Node
                    C has a child G. Node D has children H and I. Node E has children J
                    and K. Node K has children O and P. Node H has children L, M, and N."
                    height="300" width="650" />

                    <br/>Now assume we collect the following count data for each of the
                    words: <br/><br/> J = 100 <br/> O = 100 <br/> P = 100 <br/> F = 100
                    <br/> G = 100 <br/> L = 100 <br/> M = 100 <br/> N = 100 <br/> I = 200
                    <br/>

                    <br/><br/>


                    Assuming that all other words do not appear in the corpus, what is
                    <code>\text{sim}_\text{resnick}(J, P)</code>? Round your answer to two decimal
                    places (e.g. 0.35, 0.60, 1.43) and use natural log in your
                    calculation.

            <p>Observe that there are no counts for internal nodes. Thus we can calculate
            the probability of any node by only examining the counts of the leaves of the
            subtree rooted at that node.</p>
            <p>We can solve this problem by first taking the lowest common subsumer of the
            two words. We can calculate the probability of that lowest common subsumer by
            summing up the counts of words in the subtree rooted at the lowest common
            subsumer (which in this case is simply summing over all the leaves) and
            dividing that number by 1000, the number of words in the corpus. We then take
            the negative log of that probability to obtain our answer.</p>
