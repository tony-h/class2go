<h3>About the Course</h3> <p align="justify"> This is an introductory course on computer
networking, specifically the Internet. It focuses on explaining how the Internet works,
ranging from how bits are modulated on wires and in wireless to application-level
protocols like BitTorrent and HTTP. Students implement a handful of low-level protocols
and services, including reliable transport, IP forwarding, and a Network Address
Translation device. Students gain experience reading and understanding RFCs (Internet
protocol specifications) as statements of what a system should do. The course grounds many
of the concepts in current practice and recent developments, such as net neutrality and
DNS security. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b>Nick McKeown</b> has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at Stanford University since 1995. He grew up in the UK and received his
BEng from Leeds University in 1986. He moved to the US in 1989 to do an MS and PhD in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California at Berkeley. His
research group works on new Internet architectures, software-defined networks and how to
make routers faster. He co-founded several companies based on technology started at
Stanford. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and recently received the
ACM Sigcomm "Lifetime Achievement" Award. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b>Philip Levis</b> is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. He received his Sc.B. from Brown University
in 1999, his M.S. from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2001, and his Ph.D. from
UC Berkeley in 2005. In 2008 he received an NSF CAREER award and a Microsoft Research New
Faculty Fellowship. He researches the design and implementation of networked systems,
including operating systems and protocols for embedded wireless devices, wireless mesh
protocols, network infrastructure for virtual worlds, and energy efficient computing. The
results of his research, including the TinyOS operating system, nesC language, Trickle
algorithm, and the collection tree protocol (CTP), have been adopted by tens of thousands
of users and researchers worldwide. He is a co-founder and the President of Kumu Networks.
He really likes excellent engineering and has a self-destructive aversion to low-hanging
fruit. </p>
